# MoneytreeDemo
A poor attempt at demonstrating development skills to Moneytree JP

Hey Moneytree folks,

For my submission, I completed user stories 1, and 2: 
1. See accounts and balances in user's currency, grouped by institution and showing the nickname. 
2. Tapping into an account will see its list of transactions sorted from earliest to latest, their description, date, and amount in the transaction's currency.

Some things I didn't cover in the interest of time: 
- I didn't build testing into the app. I was optimizing for time, so I reverted to bad habits and didn't do test-driven development. 
- The app isn't fully accessible. I made sure to only use Dynamic Type to ensure some level of accessibility.

I left these out in the interest of time and getting you something to evaluate me by sooner rather than later. 
I hope it's obvious to my peers that better work would come if I weren't doing simultaneous pitches and interviews while completing this assignment ðŸ˜…. 

Thanks for taking the time to look over the code. 
Best,
Tim
